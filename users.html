                      I had a hard time coming up with ways to help out the community around
                      me. This app reminded me how easy and simple a small act of kindness
                      can go. Recently, my grand-puppy hurt his neck. My daughter took him
                      to the vet, and he was put on 6 medications. The next day he (the dog)
                      seemed to be very stressed out and in a lot of pain. While my daughter
                      was in school, I took my grand-puppy to the vet for second opinion

                      I always thought it would be awkward to step in and help strangers. What if they didn't want my help? However, this app challenged me to push past my comfort zone and lend a helping hand. I saw an older lady struggle in the grocery store to reach her food item off the top shelf. Nervous she would reject my help, I offered anyway. She eneded up thanking me profusely and I was able to make her day a little bit easier.

                      I told my mom I couldn't wait to be a grown up so I could help make a difference in the world. She told me I didnt need to be a grown up, and I could do things now as a kid! So when I heard my baby sister Ruby cry, I brought her binky to her, and helped put it in her mouth. She spit it out with a big smile and mommy was so proud of me.

                    There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will
                    instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states
                    that this has already happened.
