          I had a hard time coming up with ways to help out the community around
          me. This app reminded me how easy and simple a small act of kindness
          can go. Recently, my grand-puppy hurt his neck. My daughter took him
          to the vet, and he was put on 6 medications. The next day he (the dog)
          seemed to be very stressed out and in a lot of pain. While my daughter
          was in school, I took my grand-puppy to the vet for second opinion
