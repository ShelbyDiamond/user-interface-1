          How do I skip past a random act that I don't want to do?
          <p>
            For right now, you would just go ahead and click the generate button
            again. This will refresh the generator and provide you a new random
            act of kindness. We are working on having a "skip" button in future
            versions so it will not come back to you.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="list">
          Can I enter my own acts of kindness?
          <p>
            Yes! We encourage everyone to add random acts of kindness into our
            generator! If there is something special you enjoy doing for others,
            please add it!

          Is there a way to use the Random Acts Generator without logging in?
          <p>
            Right now, the only way to use the generator is to log in. This is a
            great idea for future versons to come!
