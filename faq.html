            How do I skip past a random act that I don't want to do?
            <p>
              For right now, you would just go ahead and click the generate
              button again. This will refresh the generator and provide you a
              new random act of kindness. We are working on having a "skip"
              button in future versions so it will not come back to you.

            Can I enter my own acts of kindness?
            <p>
              Yes! We encourage everyone to add random acts of kindness into our
              generator! If there is something special you enjoy doing for
              others, please add it!

            What are the benefits of doing an act of kindness?
            <p>
              Not only will it brighten your day and make you feel good about
              yourself, but it will help someone else in the community.

            Is there a way to use the Random Acts Generator without logging in?
            <p>
              Unfortunately, the only way to operate the generator is to log in.

            Do the acts of kindness cost money?
            <p>
              Some of them can cost money and some of them are free. If you get
              an act of kindness that costs outside of your budget, you can just
              click the generate button and obtain a new one!

            Is there a point system in place for each act of Kindness that we
            do?
            <p>
              We do not reward acts of kindness with prizes or reward points. We
              belive everyone should give back to the community out of the love
              in their hearts.

            What if I don’t finish the act of kindness I signed up for, do I get
            penalized?
            <p>
              There is no pentalty for not finishing your act of kindness. All
              we ask of you is that you do your best.

            Is there a t-shirt, badge, or hat we get in the mail for signing up,
            I don’t want the police being called on me for trying to help
            someone cross the street?
            <p>
              Unfortunately, we do not provide any type of uniform. It is best
              practice to ask the person if they would like for you to do your
              act of kindness with them (helping them cross the street).
